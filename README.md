## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to update existing div tags to comply with proper Search Engine Optimization. We replaced all div tags with semantic elements such as "header", "footer", "section", and "main". This makes our website more accessible to persons with disabilities and ranks our site higher in search results.

## Features

- New title
- Proper semantic elements for accessability
- Comments of changes in both index.html and style.css
- Alt attributes on all images on webpage
